			<p>Hello, my name is Yander Diaz. I was born in Cuba on April 25, 2004. At 5 years of age, my mother came to the United States and at that time I was left in the care of my grandmother, in 2011 she brought me to the United States where I started school in Third grade and then I went to school learning English since Spanish was my first language it was very difficult, now I am in 11th grade and I am attending Miami Southridge Senior Highschool, where I have made many ties with teachers and students. Some of the hobbies I do are making YouTube videos, video games to be exact, I also practice learning to play the guitar even though I haven't had a chance to get proper classes due to the current pandemic. I like to exercise because next school year I am thinking about joining a sports team. I like to make websites that I competed in at FBLA (Future Leaders of America) where my team and I won first place in a state competition. I am the vice president of an after school club called "Spartan Coders" where we learn how to code in Minecraft and make YouTube videos so that people can learn to code in Minecraft and make the game more fun.
